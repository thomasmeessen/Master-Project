	abstract = {Muscle{\textendash}tendon units about the ankle joint generate a burst of positive power during the step-to-step transition in human walking, termed ankle push-off, but there is no scientific consensus on its functional role. A central question embodied in the biomechanics literature is: does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing, or to center of mass (COM) acceleration? This question has been debated in various forms for decades. However, it actually presents a false dichotomy, as these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. If we ask either question independently, the answer is the same: yes! (1) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing acceleration? Yes. (2) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to COM acceleration? Yes. Here, we summarize the historical debate, then synthesize the seemingly polarized perspectives and demonstrate that both descriptions are valid. The principal means by which ankle push-off affects COM mechanics is by a localized action that increases the speed and kinetic energy of the trailing push-off limb. Because the limb is included in body COM computations, this localized segmental acceleration also accelerates the COM, and most of the segmental energy change also appears as COM energy change. Interpretation of ankle mechanics should abandon an either/or contrast of leg swing versus COM acceleration. Instead, ankle push-off should be interpreted in light of both mutually consistent effects. This unified perspective informs our fundamental understanding of the role of ankle push-off, and has important implications for the design of clinical interventions (e.g. prostheses, orthoses) intended to restore locomotor function to individuals with disabilities.},

abstract = "The net force and moment of a joint have been widely used to understand joint disease in the foot. Meanwhile, it does not reflect the physiological forces on muscles and contact surfaces. The objective of the study is to estimate active moments by muscles, passive moments by connective tissues and joint contact forces in the foot joints during walking. Joint kinematics and external forces of ten healthy subjects (all males, 24.7 ± 1.2 years) were acquired during walking. The data were entered into the five-segment musculoskeletal foot model to calculate muscle forces and joint contact forces of the foot joints using an inverse dynamics-based optimization. Joint reaction forces and active, passive and net moments of each joint were calculated from muscle and ligament forces. The maximum joint reaction forces were 8.72, 4.31, 2.65, and 3.41 body weight (BW) for the ankle, Chopart’s, Lisfranc and metatarsophalangeal joints, respectively. Active and passive moments along with net moments were also obtained. The maximum net moments were 8.6, 8.4, 5.4 and 0.8\%BW∙HT, respectively. While the trend of net moment was very similar between the four joints, the magnitudes and directions of the active and passive moments varied between joints. The active and passive moments during walking could reveal the roles of muscles and ligaments in each of the foot joints, which was not obvious in the net moment. This method may help narrow down the source of joint problems if applied to clinical studies."

Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects’ gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by +-35\% and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation."

    abstract = { The present study was designed to explore how the interaction between the fascicles and tendinous tissues is involved in storage and utilization of elastic energy during human walking. Eight male subjects walked with a natural cadence (1.4 ± 0.1 m/s) on a 10-m-long force plate system. In vivo techniques were employed to record the Achilles tendon force and to scan real-time fascicle lengths for two muscles (medial gastrocnemius and soleus). The results showed that tendinous tissues of both medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles lengthened slowly throughout the single-stance phase and then recoiled rapidly close to the end of the ground contact. However, the fascicle length changes demonstrated different patterns and amplitudes between two muscles. The medial gastrocnemius fascicles were stretched during the early single-stance phase and then remained isometrically during the late-stance phase. In contrast, the soleus fascicles were lengthened until the end of the single-stance phase. These findings suggest that the elastic recoil takes place not as a spring-like bouncing but as a catapult action in natural human walking. The interaction between the muscle fascicles and tendinous tissues plays an important role in the process of release of elastic energy, although the leg muscles, which are commonly accepted as synergists, do not have similar mechanical behavior of fascicles in this catapult action. }

Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33\% less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97\% of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94\% of the double support negative work."

We hypothesized that subjects would show a neuromotor and metabolic adaptation during a 24min walking trial with a powered exoskeleton. Nine female subjects walked on a treadmill at 1.36±0.04ms−1 during 24min with a powered exoskeleton and 4min with an unpowered exoskeleton. Subjects showed a metabolic adaptation after 18.5±5.0min, followed by an adapted period. Metabolic cost, electromyography and kinematics were compared between the unpowered condition, the beginning of the adaptation and the adapted period. In the beginning of the adaptation (4min), a reduction in metabolic cost of 9% was found compared to the unpowered condition. This reduction was accompanied by reduced muscular activity in the plantarflexor muscles, as the powered exoskeleton delivered part of the necessary ankle extension moment. During the adaptation this metabolic reduction further increased to 16%, notwithstanding a constant exoskeleton assistance. This increased reduction is the result of a neuromotor adaptation in which subjects adapt to walking with the exoskeleton, thereby reducing muscular activity in all leg muscles. Because of the fast adaptation and the significant reductions in metabolic cost we want to highlight the potential of an ankle-foot exoskeleton with kinematic control that assists ankle extension during push-off."

Exoskeletons that assist walking have the potential to restore walking capacity by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, it is unclear if current exoskeletons can reduce energy cost in elderly. Our goal was to study the effect of an exoskeleton that assists plantarflexion during push-off on the metabolic energy cost of walking in physically active and healthy elderly. Seven elderly (age 69.3±3.5y) walked on treadmill (1.11ms2) with normal shoes and with the exoskeleton both powered (with assistance) and powered-off (without assistance). After 20min of habituation on a prior day and 5min on the test day, subjects were able to walk with the exoskeleton and assistance of the exoskeleton resulted in a reduction in metabolic cost of 12\% versus walking with the exoskeleton powered-off. Walking with the exoskeleton was perceived less fatiguing for the muscles compared to normal walking. Assistance resulted in a statistically nonsignificant reduction in metabolic cost of 4\% versus walking with normal shoes, likely due to the penalty of wearing the exoskeleton powered-off. Also, exoskeleton mechanical power was relatively low compared to previously identified optimal assistance magnitude in young adults. Future exoskeleton research should focus on further optimizing exoskeleton assistance for specific populations and on considerate integration of exoskeletons in rehabilitation or in daily life. As such, exoskeletons should allow people to walk longer or faster than without assistance and could result in an increase in physical activity and resulting health benefits."

abstract = "Humans tend to walk economically, with preferred step width and length corresponding to an energetic optimum. In the case of step width, it is costlier to walk with either wider or narrower steps than normally preferred. Wider steps require more mechanical work to redirect the body’s motion laterally with each step, but the cost for narrower steps remains unexplained. Here we show that narrow steps are costly because they require the swing leg to be circumducted around the stance leg. Healthy adults (N=8) were tested walking with varying levels of circumduction, induced through lightweight, physical obstructions (“Fins”) attached medially to the lower legs, during treadmill walking at fixed speed (1.25ms−1) and step width. The net rate of metabolic energy expenditure increased approximately with the square of circumduction amplitude, by about 50\% for an amplitude (measured at mid-swing) of about 18cm. Subjects also generated greater stance leg torque and more arm motion to counter the circumduction, among other compensatory motions that may contribute to energy expenditure. The costs of producing and countering lateral leg motion partially explains the poorer economy of some gait pathologies where circumduction may occur, for example stiff-knee gait. And for healthy individuals, it explains how the energetically optimal average step width, along with the additional variability inherent with multiple steps, should be narrow enough to avoid excessive redirection of the body, yet wide enough to avoid costly circumduction. Humans appear to prefer a step width that compromises between the competing energetic costs for either wider or narrower steps."

abstract = "Background
The gait mechanism requires an efficient intersegmental coordination in order to ensure the displacement of the body while simultaneously maintaining the postural stability. However, intersegmental coordination may be disrupted by neurological or orthopaedic involvement, this increasing the metabolic cost associated with excessive or prolonged muscle co-contraction.
Research question
Our aim was to evaluate and to understand how hip OA affects lower limbs coordination during gait by using the kinematic segmental covariation law method and predict the energy expenditure.
Methods
In order to evaluate the influence of unilateral alteration of the lower limbs on the gait mechanism, three groups namely 63 hip osteoarthritis patients, 65 chronic hemiparetic stroke patients and 72 healthy subjects performed an instrumented gait analysis. The subjects had to walk barefoot for at least 3 min at a self-selected speed on a force measuring motor-driven treadmill. The biomechanical variables (kinematic, kinetic and energetical cost) were simultaneously recorded.
Results
The comparison between the three groups was tested using a repeated measure ANOVA. All biomechanical parameters show significant differences between the 3 groups highlighting the gait alteration for the patients groups. However, the energetic cost remains normal in the hip osteoarthritis group despite of the alteration of the other variables. A multivariate analysis allowed to identify the independent variables affecting more specifically their gait mechanisms.
Significance
This study showed the importance of quantitative functional evaluation in order to better understand the impact of hip osteoarthritis on the gait mechanism. The biomechanical analysis provides objective evidence of the altered gait mechanism and more particularly of the intersegmental coordination in these patients. This gait analysis is therefore an interesting tool in the functional evaluation of the patient to better guide the diagnosis."

abstract = "We propose a new method for calibrating force plates to reduce errors in center of pressure locations, forces, and moments. These errors may be caused by imperfect mounting of force plates to the ground or by installation of a treadmill atop a force plate, which may introduce distorting loads. The method, termed the Post-Installation Least-Squares (PILS) calibration, combines features of several previous methods into a simple procedure. It requires a motion capture system and an instrumented pole for applying reference loads. Reference loads may be manually applied to the force plate in arbitrary locations and directions. The instrumented pole measures applied load magnitudes through a single-axis load cell, and load directions through motion capture markers. Reference data and imperfect force plate signals are then combined to form a linear calibration matrix that simultaneously minimizes mean square errors in all forces and moments. We applied the procedure to standard laboratory force plates, as well as a custom-built, split-belt force treadmill. We also collected an independent set of verification data for testing. The proposed calibration procedure was found to reduce force errors by over 20\%, and moment errors by over 60\%. Center of pressure errors were also reduced by 63\% for standard force plates and 91\% for the force treadmill. The instrumented pole is advantageous because it allows for fast and arbitrary load application without needing a precise fixture for aligning loads. The linear calibration matrix is simpler than nonlinear correction equations and more compatible with standard data acquisition software, yet it yields error reductions comparable to more complex methods."

While the accuracy of the resulting kinetic data is critical for accurate gait analysis, factors such as plate mounting are thought to influence the measured point of force application (PFA) of the ground reaction forces. The aim of this study was therefore to present an accurate in-situ PFA calibration method. In addition, the approach was evaluated by examining the required PFA corrections over a period of ten years, which included plate remounting and a change of foundation. The in-situ PFA calibration was performed on six plates by assessing the locations of up to 98 points of force application per plate using an instrumented pole. Application of the in-situ PFA calibration approach reduced the root mean square errors by up to approximately 60\% compared to the manufacturers calculation. Correction coefficients were strongly dependent on the individual platform as well as the location of the applied force on the plate. Remounting of the plates altered the plate coefficient corrections considerably, while changes over time were notable but not as extensive. We therefore recommend that plates should be recalibrated after remounting, but also at least every 5 years, in order to ensure the preservation of an accurate PFA."

    abstract = {Background The energy that animals devote to locomotion has been of intense interest to biologists for decades and two basic methodologies have emerged to predict locomotor energy expenditure: those based on metabolic and those based on mechanical energy. Metabolic energy approaches share the perspective that prediction of locomotor energy expenditure should be based on statistically significant proxies of metabolic function, while mechanical energy approaches, which derive from many different perspectives, focus on quantifying the energy of movement. Some controversy exists as to which mechanical perspective is “best”, but from first principles all mechanical methods should be equivalent if the inputs to the simulation are of similar quality. Our goals in this paper are 1) to establish the degree to which the various methods of calculating mechanical energy are correlated, and 2) to investigate to what degree the prediction methods explain the variation in energy expenditure.   Methodology/Principal Findings We use modern humans as the model organism in this experiment because their data are readily attainable, but the methodology is appropriate for use in other species. Volumetric oxygen consumption and kinematic and kinetic data were collected on 8 adults while walking at their self-selected slow, normal and fast velocities. Using hierarchical statistical modeling via ordinary least squares and maximum likelihood techniques, the predictive ability of several metabolic and mechanical approaches were assessed. We found that all approaches are correlated and that the mechanical approaches explain similar amounts of the variation in metabolic energy expenditure. Most methods predict the variation within an individual well, but are poor at accounting for variation between individuals.   Conclusion Our results indicate that the choice of predictive method is dependent on the question(s) of interest and the data available for use as inputs. Although we used modern humans as our model organism, these results can be extended to other species.},

The calibration device was used to apply static and dynamic calibrating loads to the surface of the IT at 189 and 25 grid-points, respectively, at four belt speeds (0, 4, 6 and 8km/h) without the need of a preset template. Part of the applied and measured RF and COP were used to train a threelayered, back-propagation ANN model while the rest of the data were used to evaluate the performance of the ANN. The percent errors of Fz and errors of the Px and Py were significantly decreased from a maximum of −1.15\%, −1.64mm and −0.73mm to 0.02\%, 0.02mm and 0.03mm during static calibration, respectively.

This study examined how this protocol can be further optimized to maximize accuracy, by varying the measurement time and number of spots, using nonlinear approaches to calculate the calibration matrix and by correcting for potential inhomogeneity in the distribution of COP errors across the treadmill's surface. The accuracy increased with addition of spots and correction for the inhomogeneous distribution across the belt surface, decreased with reduction of measurement time, and did not improve by including nonlinear terms. Most of these methods improved the overall accuracy only to a limited extent, suggesting that the maximal accuracy is approached given the treadmill's inherent mechanical limitations. However, both correction for position dependence of the accuracy as well as its optimization within the walking area are found to be valuable additions to the standard calibration process."

abstract = "Instrumented treadmills are becoming more common in gait analysis. Due to their large and compliant structure, errors in force measurements are expected to be higher compared with conventional force plates. There is, however, no consistency in the literature on testing the performance of these treadmills. Therefore, we propose a standard protocol to assess and report error sources in instrumented treadmills. The first part of this protocol consists of assessment of the accuracy of forces and center of pressure (COP), including non-linearity, hysteresis and crosstalk. The second part consists of (novel) instrumented resonance testing and belt speed variability tests. The third part focuses on measurement variability over time, including drift, warming of the system and noise. The performance of two in-house instrumented treadmills with different dynamics was measured. Differences were found between the treadmills in COP accuracy (4.0 mm versus 6.5 mm), lowest eigen frequency (35 Hz versus 23 Hz) and noise level at 5 km/h (10 N versus 29 N). The loaded treadmills both showed a 3.3\% belt speed variability at 5 km/h. Thus, the protocol was able to characterize strong and weak characteristics of the treadmills and allowed for a proper judgement on the validity of the instruments and their application in the domain of gait analysis. We propose to use this protocol when testing and reporting the performance of instrumented treadmills."

abstract={Treadmill-based gait analysis is widely used to investigate walking pathologies and quantify treatment effects on locomotion. Differential sensorimotor conditions during overground vs. treadmill walking necessitate initial familiarization to treadmill walking. Currently, there is no standardized treadmill acclimatization protocol and insufficient familiarization potentially confounds analyses. We monitored initial adaptations to treadmill walking in 40 healthy adults. Twenty-six walking parameters were assessed over 10 minutes with marker-based kinematic analysis and acclimatization profiles were generated. While 16 walking parameters demonstrated initial acclimatization followed by plateau performance, ten parameters remained stable. Distal lower limb control including ankle range of motion, toe trajectory and foot clearance underwent substantial adaptations. Moreover, intralimb coordination and gait variability also demonstrated acclimatization, while measures of symmetry and interlimb coordination did not. All parameters exhibiting a plateau after acclimatization did so within 6-7 minutes (425 strides). Older participants and those na{\"i}ve to treadmill walking showed adaptations with higher amplitudes but over similar timescales. Our results suggest a minimum of 6 minutes treadmill acclimatization is required to reach a stable performance, and that this should suffice for both?older and na{\"i}ve healthy adults. The presented data aids in optimizing treadmill-based gait analysis and contributes to improving locomotor assessments in research and clinical settings.},

Inverse dynamics is often employed to estimate joint-level contributions, and deformable body estimates can be used to study work performed by the foot. We recently discovered that these commonly used experimental estimates fail to explain whole-body energy changes observed during human walking. By re-analyzing previously published data, we found that about 25\% (8 J) of total positive energy changes of/about the body{\textquoteright}s center-of-mass and \&gt;30\% of the energy changes during the Push-off phase of walking were not explained by conventional joint- and segment-level work estimates, exposing a gap in our fundamental understanding of work production during gait. Here, we present a novel Energy-Accounting analysis that integrates various empirical measures of work and energy to elucidate the source of unexplained biomechanical work. We discovered that by extending conventional 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) inverse dynamics (estimating rotational work about joints) to 6DOF (rotational and translational) analysis of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, we could fully explain the missing positive work. This revealed that Push-off work performed about the hip may be \&gt;50\% greater than conventionally estimated (9.3 versus 6.0 J, P=0.0002, at 1.4 m~s-1). Our findings demonstrate that 6DOF analysis (of hip{\textendash}knee{\textendash}ankle{\textendash}foot) better captures energy changes of the body than more conventional 3DOF estimates. These findings refine our fundamental understanding of how work is distributed within the body, which has implications for assistive technology, biomechanical simulations and potentially clinical treatment.},

	abstract = {Rapid unloading and a peak in power output of the ankle joint have been widely observed during push-off in human walking. Model-based studies hypothesize that this push-off causes redirection of the body center of mass just before touch-down of the leading leg. Other research suggests that work done by the ankle extensors provides kinetic energy for the initiation of swing. Also, muscle work is suggested to power a catapult-like action in late stance of human walking. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the biomechanical process leading to this widely observed high power output of the ankle extensors. In our study, we use kinematic and dynamic data of human walking collected at speeds between 0.5 and 2.5 m s-1 for a comprehensive analysis of push-off mechanics. We identify two distinct phases, which divide the push-off: first, starting with positive ankle power output, an alleviation phase, where the trailing leg is alleviated from supporting the body mass, and second, a launching phase, where stored energy in the ankle joint is released. Our results show a release of just a small part of the energy stored in the ankle joint during the alleviation phase. A larger impulse for the trailing leg than for the remaining body is observed during the launching phase. Here, the buckling knee joint inhibits transfer of power from the ankle to the remaining body. It appears that swing initiation profits from an impulsive ankle push-off resulting from a catapult without escapement.},

    abstract = { The present study was designed to explore how the interaction between the fascicles and tendinous tissues is involved in storage and utilization of elastic energy during human walking. Eight male subjects walked with a natural cadence (1.4 ± 0.1 m/s) on a 10-m-long force plate system. In vivo techniques were employed to record the Achilles tendon force and to scan real-time fascicle lengths for two muscles (medial gastrocnemius and soleus). The results showed that tendinous tissues of both medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles lengthened slowly throughout the single-stance phase and then recoiled rapidly close to the end of the ground contact. However, the fascicle length changes demonstrated different patterns and amplitudes between two muscles. The medial gastrocnemius fascicles were stretched during the early single-stance phase and then remained isometrically during the late-stance phase. In contrast, the soleus fascicles were lengthened until the end of the single-stance phase. These findings suggest that the elastic recoil takes place not as a spring-like bouncing but as a catapult action in natural human walking. The interaction between the muscle fascicles and tendinous tissues plays an important role in the process of release of elastic energy, although the leg muscles, which are commonly accepted as synergists, do not have similar mechanical behavior of fascicles in this catapult action. }

While providing more pushoff is known to decrease sagittal plane hip moments, it is unknown if this gait modification also decreases hip joint forces. The purpose of this study was to determine if increasing pushoff decreases hip joint forces. Nine healthy subjects walked on an instrumented force treadmill at 1.25m/s under two walking conditions. For the natural condition, subjects were instructed to walk as they normally would. For the increased pushoff condition, subjects were instructed to “push more with your foot when you walk”. We collected motion data of markers placed on the subjects׳ trunk and lower extremities to capture trunk and leg kinematics and ground reaction force data to determine joint moments. Data were processed in Visual3D to produce the inverse kinematics and model scaling files. In OpenSim, the generic gait model (Gait2392) was scaled to the subject, and hip joint forces were calculated for the femur on the acetabulum after computing the muscle activations necessary to reproduce the experimental data. The instruction to “push more with your foot when you walk” reduced the maximum hip flexion and extension moment compared to the natural condition. The average reduction in the hip joint forces were 12.5%, 3.2% and 9.6% in the anterior, superior and medial directions respectively and 2.3% for the net resultant force. Increasing pushoff may be an effective gait modification for people with anterior hip pain."

   Abstract={Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite-and perhaps because of-their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb's residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer's paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle's swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3% increase in the paretic limb's generation of forward propulsion (P < 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3% reduction in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.}

abstract={Traditional compliance control of a rehabilitation robot is implemented in task space by using impedance or admittance control algorithms. The soft robot actuated by pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) is becoming prominent for patients as it enables the compliance being adjusted in each active link, which, however, has not been reported in the literature. This paper proposes a new compliance control method of a soft ankle rehabilitation robot that is driven by four PMAs configured in parallel to enable three degrees of freedom movement of the ankle joint. A new hierarchical compliance control structure, including a low-level compliance adjustment controller in joint space and a high-level admittance controller in task space, is designed. An adaptive compliance control paradigm is further developed by taking into account patient's active contribution and movement ability during a previous period of time, in order to provide robot assistance only when it is necessarily required. Experiments on healthy and impaired human subjects were conducted to verify the adaptive hierarchical compliance control scheme. The results show that the robot hierarchical compliance can be online adjusted according to the participant's assessment. The robot reduces its assistance output when participants contribute more and vice versa, thus providing a potentially feasible solution to the patient-in-loop cooperative training strategy.},

abstract={Assist-as-Needed (AAN) strategy is one strategy of administering robotic assistance which has gained wide acceptance in recent time and has been clinically demonstrated to provoke motor recovery in neurologically impaired patients. The underlying principle in this scheme is to provide assistance to a patient to complete desired movement only when the patient is in need of that assistance, which invariably encourages patient's active participation to provoke neuroplasticity. Effective deployment of this scheme in robot aided therapy still pose some challenges. One current difficulty is finding an appropriate method of estimating patients' functional input, or movement ability, by means on which the robot judges whether to assist or to relax the assistance. Another concern is the repeatability or consistency of the estimated subject's movement ability across a wide range of subjects with different disability level that can warrant a broad clinical adoption. Also, generally overlooked is the influence of subject's recovery progress on the modality of the AAN assistance. In this study, we propose a progress-based assist-as-needed algorithm (pAAN) which rely on subject's real-time functional ability record to drive robotic assistance. We define a novel functional ability index (FAI) on a baseline adaptive inertia related controller which decays the robotic torque assistance according to patients' progress or active participation during therapy session. Simulation studies carried out for the task of lifting a can from table to the mouth, designed in accordance with the Wolf motor function test (WMFT), have demonstrated the feasibility of the pAAN strategy.},

   Abstract={Coactivation of antagonist muscles is readily observed early in motor learning, in interactions with unstable mechanical environments and in motor system pathologies. Here we present evidence that the nervous system uses coactivation control far more extensively and that patterns of cocontraction during movement are closely tied to the specific requirements of the task. We have examined the changes in cocontraction that follow dynamics learning in tasks that are thought to involve finely sculpted feedforward adjustments to motor commands. We find that, even following substantial training, cocontraction varies in a systematic way that depends on both movement direction and the strength of the external load. The proportion of total activity that is due to cocontraction nevertheless remains remarkably constant. Moreover, long after indices of motor learning and electromyographic measures have reached asymptotic levels, cocontraction still accounts for a significant proportion of total muscle activity in all phases of movement and in all load conditions. These results show that even following dynamics learning in predictable and stable environments, cocontraction forms a central part of the means by which the nervous system regulates movement.}

   Abstract={The aims of the present study were to quantify the impairment in ankle coactivation on the paretic and non-paretic sides of subjects with hemiparesis and to examine the relationship of ankle coactivation with postural instability, motor deficit of the paretic lower extremity and locomotor performance. Electromyography of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were recorded bilaterally during gait in 30 subjects (62.1+/-9.9 years) who had suffered a recent stroke (<6 months) as well as on one side of 17 healthy controls (59.3+/-9.1 years) walking at very slow speed. Ankle muscle coactivation was calculated by dividing the time of overlap between MG and TA signals (threshold of 20 microV) by the duration of the gait phases of interest: stance, swing, first and second double support sub-phases and single support sub-phase. The time spent in single support and the peak plantarflexor moment of force on the paretic side were used to measure, respectively, postural stability and dynamic strength of the paretic plantarflexors. The subjects with hemiparesis demonstrated less coactivation on the paretic side during the single support sub-phase (p<0.01) and more coactivation during first and second double support sub-phases on the non-paretic side (p<0.001) compared to control values. The patients with coactivation patterns that differed the most from controls were the patients with the more severe impairments and disabilities. While the reduced coactivation on the paretic side may contribute to poor postural stability and poor locomotor performance, the presence of excessive coactivation on the non-paretic side when both limbs were in ground contact may be an adaptation to help maintain postural stability during gait.}

Although several recent studies have observed increased muscular coactivation during walking in older adults, little is known about the relationship between fear of falling and muscular coactivation during walking. The purpose of this study was to compare muscular coactivation during walking between older adults with fear of falling and older adults without fear of falling.\\ Thirty-eight healthy older adults (82.3 ± 6.8 years) participated in this study. Walking speed and step length were measured. Electromyography (EMG) data were collected from the tibialis anterior and soleus during walking to calculate the co-contraction index (CI). Subjects were divided into those with fear of falling and those without fear of falling, on the basis of a modified Falls Efficacy Scale (FES). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used, with CI as the dependent variable, and fear of falling, experience of falling (during the past year), walking speed, step length, and age as independent variables.\\ Mean values of CI during walking, walking speed, and step length were 51.9 ± 11.7%, 0.90 ± 0.40 m/s, and 0.43±0.11 m, respectively. Eight subjects (21.1%) had fallen within the past year, and 19 subjects (50.0%) had fear of falling. All subjects without fear of falling had FES scores of 10 (maximum score). Subjects with fear of falling had a median FES score of 17 (interquartile range, 13 to 25). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that fear of falling remained significantly associated with CI (p<0.01): CIs for subjects with fear and those without fear were 59.5 ± 12.2% and 46.7 ± 8.5%, respectively.\\ Individuals with a fear of falling have increased muscular co-activation at the ankle joint during walking, at least in a certain subgroup of older adults. Further research is needed to clarify negative and positive effects of muscular coactivation during walking in fearful subjects.}

   Abstract={The purpose of the present study was the quantification of the co-activation patterns of the knee extensor and flexor muscles during walking at self-selected speed and cadence. To this aim, the Statistical Gait Analysis, a recent methodology providing a statistical characterization of gait, was performed on surface EMG signals from Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Medial Hamstrings (MH) in 14 healthy young adult subjects. Muscular co-contraction was assessed as the overlapping period between activation intervals of agonist and antagonist muscles. Superimpositions between VL and MH activity were detected from terminal swing to the following loading response in 100% of the considered strides. This superimposition could be intended as an actual co-contraction of VL and MH, working across the same joint, the knee. It occurs in this gait phase likely in order to assist knee extension, developing muscle tension for weight acceptance during loading response, and to control knee flexion. A further less frequent (28.9±13.6% of the strides, P<;0.001) superimposition was detected in terminal stance; this superimposition, however, should not be considered a real co-contraction, because VL and MH work on different joints. These findings have the merit to provide a novel data on the variability of the reciprocal role of VL and MH during walking, allowing a deeper insight in the physiological mechanisms that regulate the knee flexion/extension.}

   Abstract={To investigate the nature of variability present in time series generated from gait parameters of two different age groups via a nonlinear analysis.\\ Measures of nonlinear dynamics were used to compare kinematic parameters between elderly and young females.\\ Aging may lead to changes in motor variability during walking, which may explain the large incidence of falls in the elderly.\\ Twenty females, 10 younger (20-37 yr) and 10 older (71-79 yr) walked on a treadmill for 30 consecutive gait cycles. Time series from selected kinematic parameters of the right lower extremity were analyzed using nonlinear dynamics. The largest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension of all time series, and the largest Lyapunov exponent of the original time series surrogated were calculated. Standard deviations and coefficient of variations were also calculated for selected discrete points from each gait cycle. Independent t-tests were used for statistical comparisons.\\ The Lyapunov exponents were found to be significantly different from their surrogate counterparts. This indicates that the fluctuations observed in the time series may reflect deterministic processes by the neuromuscular system. The elderly exhibited significantly larger Lyapunov exponents and correlation dimensions for all parameters evaluated indicating local instability. The linear measures indicated that the elderly demonstrated significantly higher variability.\\ The nonlinear analysis revealed that fluctuations in the time series of certain gait parameters are not random but display a deterministic behavior. This behavior may degrade with physiologic aging resulting in local instability.\\ Elderly show increased local instability or inability to compensate to the natural stride-to-stride variations present during locomotion. We hypothesized that this may be the one of the reasons for the increases in falling due to aging. Future efforts should attempt to evaluate this hypothesis by making comparisons to pathological subjects (i.e. elderly fallers), and examine the sensitivity and specificity of the nonlinear methods used in this study to aid clinical assessment.}

abstract={The focus of this study was to examine the role of walking velocity in stability during normal gait. Local dynamic stability was quantified through the use of maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents, lambda(Max). These quantify the rate of attenuation of kinematic variability of joint angle data recorded as subjects walked on a motorized treadmill at 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, and 80\% of the Froude velocity. A monotonic trend between lambda(Max) and walking velocity was observed with smaller lambda(Max) at slower walking velocities. Smaller lambda(Max) indicates more stable walking dynamics. This trend was evident whether stride duration variability remained or was removed by time normalizing the data. This suggests that slower walking velocities lead to increases in stability. These results may reveal more detailed information on the behavior of the neuro-controller than variability-based analyses alone.},

   Abstract={Lower-limb assistive robotic devices are often evaluated by measuring a reduction in the user's energy cost. Using indirect calorimetry to estimate energy cost is poorly suited for real-time estimation and long-term collection. The goal of this study was to use data from wearable sensors to predict energy cost with better temporal resolution and less variability than breath measurements. We collected physiological data (heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature) and mechanical data (EMG, accelerometry) from three healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at various speeds on level ground, inclined, and backwards. Ground truth energy cost was established by averaging steady-state breath measurements. Raw physiological signals correlated well with ground truth energy cost, but raw mechanical signals did not. Correlation of mechanical signals was improved by calculating accelerometer magnitudes and linear envelope EMG signals, and further improved by averaging the signals over several seconds. A multiple linear regression including physiological and mechanical data accurately predicted ground truth energy cost across all subjects and activities tested, with less variability and better temporal resolution than breath measurements. The sensors used in this study were fully portable, and such algorithms could be used to estimate energy cost of users in the real world. This could greatly improve the design, control, and evaluation of lower-limb assistive robotic devices.}

abstract = "Amputees using passive ankle-foot prostheses tend to expend more metabolic energy during walking than non-amputees, and reducing this cost has been a central motivation for the development of active ankle–foot prostheses. Increased push-off work at the end of stance has been proposed as a way to reduce metabolic energy use, but the effects of push-off work have not been tested in isolation. In this experiment, participants with unilateral transtibial amputation (N=6) walked on a treadmill at a constant speed while wearing a powered prosthesis emulator. The prosthesis delivered different levels of ankle push-off work across conditions, ranging from the value for passive prostheses to double the value for non-amputee walking, while all other prosthesis mechanics were held constant. Participants completed six acclimation sessions prior to a data collection in which metabolic rate, kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity and user satisfaction were recorded. Metabolic rate was not affected by net prosthesis work rate (p=0.5; R2=0.007). Metabolic rate, gait mechanics and muscle activity varied widely across participants, but no participant had lower metabolic rate with higher levels of push-off work. User satisfaction was affected by push-off work (p=0.002), with participants preferring values of ankle push-off slightly higher than in non-amputee walking, possibly indicating other benefits. Restoring or augmenting ankle push-off work is not sufficient to improve energy economy for lower-limb amputees. Additional necessary conditions might include alternate timing or control, individualized tuning, or particular subject characteristics."

abstract = "Assistive device technology is rapidly improving with the advent of human-in-the-loop optimization algorithms. These
algorithms find an optimal set of parameters to reduce the energy cost of movement. However, energy cost is a difficult quantity to
measure and is thus the limiting factor in the optimization time. In an effort to both improve the time to optimize parameters and to take
the device out of the lab, we were interested in predicting cost from other easier-to-measure features. We fit models to both update
online in a real-world application (i.e., linear regression) and capture the complexity of the data (i.e., neural networks). Each model
performed reasonably well, and the feature and example sets were further adjusted to test different aspects of the complexity in the
human-machine system. To counteract the high bias, the feature space was reduced in the linear models. To understand the
contribution of the intersubject variability, neural networks were trained both for the general population and individual subjects. These
models show promise for use in these different applications, but more data needs to be collected before we can implement this on the
real system."

   Abstract={The increasing capabilities of exoskeletons and powered prosthetics for walking assistance have paved the way for more sophisticated and individualized control strategies. In response to this opportunity, recent work on human-in-the-loop optimization has considered the problem of automatically tuning control parameters based on realtime physiological measurements. However, the common use of metabolic cost as a performance metric creates significant experimental challenges due to its long measurement times and low signal-to-noise ratio. We evaluate the use of Bayesian optimization-a family of sample-efficient, noise-tolerant, and global optimization methods-for quickly identifying near-optimal control parameters. To manage experimental complexity and provide comparisons against related work, we consider the task of minimizing metabolic cost by optimizing walking step frequencies in unaided human subjects. Compared to an existing approach based on gradient descent, Bayesian optimization identified a near-optimal step frequency with a faster time to convergence (12 minutes, p < 0.01), smaller inter-subject variability in convergence time (± 2 minutes, p < 0.01), and lower overall energy expenditure (p < 0.01).}

   Abstract={Measurement of the metabolic cost of walking inconveniences subjects, and requires skilled technical support and expensive equipment. These factors have stimulated interest in predictive equations. The present study assessed existing equations. Under each of 17 combinations of gradient (0-6%) and carried load (4.1-37.4 kg), 7-12 men undertook treadmill walking at 1.67 m/s. Measured oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange ratio were used to calculate metabolic rate (MRobserved). Metabolic rate was also predicted from the equation of Pandolf et al. (1977) (MRpandolf) and, where appropriate, from another five equations relating to walking without loads. MRobserved and MRpandolf did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05) under any combination of gradient and load. The overall mean MRobserved and MRpandolf of 609 W and 602 W, respectively, also did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05). These variables were highly correlated (r = 0.94) with a standard deviation about the prediction error of 47 W. For level walking without loads, the mean predictions from the equations of Pandolf et al. (1977) and Cotes and Meade (1960) did not differ significantly (p greater than 0.05) from the mean MRobserved of 428 Watts, but four other equations overestimated by 17-74 W. In conclusion, the Pandolf et al. (1977) equation has given good results across the range of combinations of load and gradient tested, and the errors are considered acceptable for most practical purposes.}

   Abstract={: Technological advancements have led to the development of numerous wearable robotic devices for the physical assistance and restoration of human locomotion. While many challenges remain with respect to the mechanical design of such devices, it is at least equally challenging and important to develop strategies to control them in concert with the intentions of the user.This work reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for controlling portable active lower limb prosthetic and orthotic (P/O) devices in the context of locomotive activities of daily living (ADL), and considers how these can be interfaced with the user's sensory-motor control system. This review underscores the practical challenges and opportunities associated with P/O control, which can be used to accelerate future developments in this field. Furthermore, this work provides a classification scheme for the comparison of the various control strategies.As a novel contribution, a general framework for the control of portable gait-assistance devices is proposed. This framework accounts for the physical and informatic interactions between the controller, the user, the environment, and the mechanical device itself. Such a treatment of P/Os--not as independent devices, but as actors within an ecosystem--is suggested to be necessary to structure the next generation of intelligent and multifunctional controllers.Each element of the proposed framework is discussed with respect to the role that it plays in the assistance of locomotion, along with how its states can be sensed as inputs to the controller. The reviewed controllers are shown to fit within different levels of a hierarchical scheme, which loosely resembles the structure and functionality of the nominal human central nervous system (CNS). Active and passive safety mechanisms are considered to be central aspects underlying all of P/O design and control, and are shown to be critical for regulatory approval of such devices for real-world use.The works discussed herein provide evidence that, while we are getting ever closer, significant challenges still exist for the development of controllers for portable powered P/O devices that can seamlessly integrate with the user's neuromusculoskeletal system and are practical for use in locomotive ADL.}
